Qs
  Which files are for prepping the images and data from the MS?
    MassSpecProteinScrape
      Takes excel from MS data, does structural search using GemPro, only pulls best structures. Also takes the names (so this is where I would switch taking
    But maybe change the names by hand, there are only thirteen
    
  How do I update my GitHub from my remote terminal?
    ls -a
      Makes sure git is initialized 
      if not there:
    git init
      if initialized:
    git status
      tells if things have been changed
    git add file_name_not_updated
      adds anything you list to the repository
    git commit
      make notes as to what chagnes you made
    git push
      pushes (finalizes) changes
     
  
  
  Need to google how to update my repository from GitHub to terminal
