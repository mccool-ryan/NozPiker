5 Sept 20 - Coding Mutli-NN

Goal: Develop a jupyter notebook that will separate proteins into categories based off of classificatins available on their respective pdb page. 

Could possibly use PyPDB to find relavent symmetry information on proteins based on MS data. (documentation: http://www.wgilpin.com/pypdb_docs/html/)
  pypdb.make_query()
    Seems most promising
    
    
After not really getting anywhere, I have decided urllib.request paired with regular expression operations is my best bet.
  I'll use this to pull up a specific pdb webpage and return the Global Symmetry.
  This will serve as the class for each protein from the MS so we can train our first NN
  Here is a RegeEx sandbox: https://regex101.com/r/cO8lqs/24
    Great for quickly making sure you're query is pulling what it is supposed to

    #also a great explainer for how to find code between two points
